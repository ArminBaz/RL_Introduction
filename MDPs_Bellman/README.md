# Lesson 2: Markov Decision Processes and Bellman Equations
These two ideas, I believe, are at the heart of reinforcement learning. So, it will pay to have a good understanding of what they are. 

There was no coding included with this portion of the lesson, so all you have to do is:

1. Read Chapter 3 of RL [textbook](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)
2. Watch [lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfHX2hHRMVQ) of UCL Course

*Why not Chapter 2?* Chapter 2 (Multi-Arm Bandits) is about a special case of RL in which there is only one state. 
I am not sure how often this is the case, but because the rest of the book focuses on MDPs, I don't think it is too useful
and neither did David Silver or the creators of this "course".
