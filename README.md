# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning 
<br/>

This is a repository I made so I can have somewhere to store my progress as I follow along with [Denny Britz's RL Repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)
<br/>

So far, I have already implemented a DeepQ Agent as part of my initiation into [Prof. Tao Gao's Lab](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~taogao/).

However, because RL is a particular area of interest for me, I thought I might as well build myself from the ground up.
<br/>


I have two main goals with this repo:
 1. I am hoping that after completing this introduction I will be proficient enough to read state of the art research and hopefully contribute.
 2. I want to document my learning process and dumb things down for myself as I learn. Hopefully others can find this useful too.
<br/>

## Requirements:
Two things are needed to follow along with the course:
 1. The Introduction to Reinforcement Learning [textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto.
 2. David Silver's [RL lectures](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) at UCL
